## What Bash scripting should not be used for

Bash scripting is powerful for automating tasks in Unix-like operating systems, but it has its limitations and should not be used for:

    Complex Data Manipulation: Tasks involving extensive data processing or manipulation are better handled by languages like Python or Perl.
    Performance-Intensive Applications: Bash is not optimized for high-performance applications. Compiled languages like C or Java are more suitable.
    GUI Development: Bash is not designed for developing graphical user interfaces.
    Complex Logic: When scripts become too complex, maintaining them in Bash becomes difficult. High-level languages like Python or Ruby offer better readability and maintainability.
    Cross-Platform Applications: Bash scripts are primarily for Unix-like systems and do not run natively on Windows without additional tools.

## What is an API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate with each other. APIs allow different software systems to interact and share data and functionality in a standardized way.
## What is a REST API

A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an API that adheres to the principles of REST, an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. Key characteristics include:

    Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request.
    Client-Server Architecture: The client and server operate independently.
    Uniform Interface: A standardized way of interacting with resources using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
    Resource-Based: Everything is considered a resource, identified by URLs.

## What are microservices

Microservices are an architectural style where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each microservice is focused on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Key benefits include:

    Scalability: Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.
    Flexibility: Different technologies and languages can be used for different services.
    Resilience: Failure in one service does not necessarily affect the entire system.
    Ease of Deployment: Smaller codebases are easier to manage and deploy.

## What is the CSV format

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data. Each line in a CSV file represents a record, and each record consists of fields separated by commas. The format is widely used for data exchange between applications because it is easy to read and write.
## What is the JSON format

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is used to represent structured data as objects and arrays, using key-value pairs. It is language-independent but widely used in web applications and APIs for data exchange.
Pythonic Package and Module Name Style

    Package Names: Should be short, all-lowercase names, preferably without underscores (e.g., mypackage).
    Module Names: Should also be short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used if it improves readability (e.g., my_module).

## Pythonic Class Name Style

    Class Names: Should use CapWords (also known as CamelCase) convention (e.g., MyClass, EmployeeRecord).

## Pythonic Variable Name Style

    Variable Names: Should be written in lowercase with words separated by underscores if necessary to improve readability (e.g., my_variable, total_count).

## Pythonic Function Name Style

    Function Names: Should be written in lowercase, with words separated by underscores to improve readability (e.g., my_function, calculate_total).

## Pythonic Constant Name Style

    Constant Names: Should be written in all uppercase letters with words separated by underscores (e.g., MAX_VALUE, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT).

## Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

CapWords or CamelCase is significant in Python as it is the convention for naming classes. This style helps distinguish class names from other identifiers such as variables and functions, enhancing code readability and maintainability. It makes it immediately clear that the identifier represents a class, which is an important aspect of Python's readability and emphasis on clear and understandable code.
